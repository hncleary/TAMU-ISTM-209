<p> Hello, my name is Hunter Cleary. I am a Computer Science student currently attending
   at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. I am also currently working to complete my minor in
   business. This site has been created as part of an assignment for one of my business classes: "Business Information
   Systems".
</p>

<p> With my Computer Science degree, I hope to pursue a career in data science. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">data scientist </a> works
  to analyze and interpret digital data. Through the use of statistical algorithms, a data scientist can
  assist in many of the decision-making aspects of a business. I am currently taking machine learning and
  artificial intelligence classes alongside the aforementioned  Business Information Systems.
  These classes will be very important for my future career.
</p>

<p> One of my current hobbies is photo and video editing. On my personal social media accounts, I make
  humorous content with these skills that relate to Texas A&M. (<a href="https://youtu.be/tpcb4yfkYHQ">See Example</a>)
  These posts have done extremely well on my personal <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2442743472425170&set=gm.2231351003743354&type=3&theater&ifg=1">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Hunter_Cleary/status/992188334104604672">Twitter</a> accounts. It has been really neat to see so many students
  react to my content. Even people that aren't A&M students have found the content and loved it.
