<!-- Paragraph #1 -->
<center>
<p>My experience <b>at</b> A&M University has been great. I love the <i>area</i>, the people,
and the classes that I'm taking. I've <u>met</u> quite a few new people and had a lot of fun
since I first first got here. I even managed to learn a bit while I was here as well.
Even though I'm excited to graduate soon, I really will miss this place and the time
in my life that it took up. </p>

<!-- Paragraph #1 -->
<center>
<p>Studying and <b>working</b> for my Computer Science degree takes up quite a bit of my time.
Even though I'm <i>often</i> occupied with lectures, math work, and coding I still find time
for small hobbies that I very much enjoy. In <u>my</u> free time that isn't spent with friends
I try to learn about new creative software suites. As mentioned on the home page
of this site, I use these pieces of software to make humorous photos and videos that I
share online with the public. Currently, I'm focused on improving my skills in 3D animation.
I hope to be able to use all my skills to create a 3D short film in the near future.</p>
